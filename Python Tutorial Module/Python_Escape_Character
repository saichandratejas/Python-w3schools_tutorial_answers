Escape Character
- To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
- An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
- An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

> Eg-1 :
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt)  # We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.
