What is a Module?

- Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
- A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

Create a Module :
- To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py


> Ex-1: Save this code in a file named mymodule.py

import mymodule
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)
mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")  


Variables in Module : The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc):


> Ex-2 : Save this code in the file mymodule.py

person1 = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 36,
  "country": "Norway"
}
