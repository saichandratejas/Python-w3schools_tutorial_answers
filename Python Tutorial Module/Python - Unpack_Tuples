Unpacking a Tuple :
- When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

> Eg-1 : Packing a tuple

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

> Eg-2 :

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)    # ("apple", "banana", "cherry")


- Using Asterisk* : 
- If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:
- ExampleGet your own Python Server
- Assign the rest of the values as a list called "red"

> Eg-3 :

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")
(green, yellow, *red) = fruits
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
