Access Items :
- List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number

> Eg-1:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])   #banana

Negative Indexing:
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

> Eg-2:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])  # cherry

Range of Indexes:
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

> Eg-3:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])    ( #cherry,orange,kiwi )
                          #This will return the items from position 2 to 5.
                          #Remember that the first item is position 0,
                          #and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included
