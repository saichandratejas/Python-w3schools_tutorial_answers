- Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.

Arrays : Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable

> Eg-1:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
print(cars)

Access the Elements of an Array: You refer to an array element by referring to the index number.


> Eg-2: Get the value of the first array item:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
x = cars[0]
print(x)   # Ford

> Eg-3 :

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars[0] = "Toyota"
print(cars)   # ['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'BMW']


- The Length of an Array : Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).


- The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.

> Eg-4: Return the number of elements in the cars array

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
x = len(cars)
print(x)    # 3


- Looping Array Elements : You can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.

> Eg-5: Print each item in the cars array:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
for x in cars:
  print(x)   #Ford
              Volvo
              BMW
              

- Adding Array Elements : You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.

> Eg-6 : Add one more element to the cars array:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.append("Honda")
print(cars)   #Ford
              Volvo
              BMW 
              Honda


- Removing Array Elements : You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.

> Eg-7 : Delete the second element of the cars array:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.pop(1)
print(cars)    #['Ford', 'BMW']


> Eg-8 : You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.

- Delete the element that has the value "Volvo"

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.remove("Volvo")
print(cars)    #['Ford', 'BMW']
