Python has two primitive loop commands:
- while loops
- for loops


The while Loop :The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

> Ex-1: With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  
  
  
The continue Statement : With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

> Ex-2 : Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)     # Note that number 3 is missing in the result
  
  
The else Statement : With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

> Ex-3 :Print a message once the condition is false

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")   #
