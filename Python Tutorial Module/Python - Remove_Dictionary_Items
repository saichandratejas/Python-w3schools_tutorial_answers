Removing Items : There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:

> Eg-1: The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict) # {'brand': 'Ford', 'year': 1964}

The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:

> Eg-2:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

The clear() method empties the dictionary:


> Eg-3:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)
