# Global Variables
> Eg-1 : 
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():

myfunc()   # This will provide the output as " Python is awesome "


> Eg-2 :
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)  # This will provide output as " Python is fantastic " as we have used variable inside the function 
myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)  # This will provide output as " Python is awesome " as we have used global variable 

> Eg-3:
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x) # This wil provide the output as "Python is fantastic" as we have declared the value of x as 'global'.

> Eg-4:
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
