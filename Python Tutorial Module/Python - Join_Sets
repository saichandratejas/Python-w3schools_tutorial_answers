Join Two Sets :
- There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
- You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another

> Eg-1 : The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets

set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)  #{2, 1, 3, 'a', 'c', 'b'}


Keep ONLY the Duplicates : The intersection_update() method will keep only the items that are present in both sets.
-Keep the items that exist in both set x, and set y

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.intersection_update(y)
print(x)   # {'apple'}

Keep All, But NOT the Duplicates : The symmetric_difference_update() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
-Keep the items that are not present in both sets:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.symmetric_difference_update(y)
print(x)


The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
- True and 1 is considered the same value:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True}
y = {"google", 1, "apple", 2}
z = x.symmetric_difference(y)
