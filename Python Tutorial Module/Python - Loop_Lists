Loop Through a List:
- You can loop through the list items by using a for loop

> Eg-1:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)     #apple
                banana
                cherry


Loop Through the Index Numbers :
- You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.
- Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

> Eg-2:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])      #apple
                          banana
                          cherry

Using a While Loop:
- You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.
- Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes.
- Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.

> Eg-3:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1     #apple
                 banana
                 cherry
                 
                 
Looping Using List Comprehension :
- List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists

> Eg-4:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
