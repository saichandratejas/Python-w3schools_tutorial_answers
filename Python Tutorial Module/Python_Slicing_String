Slicing
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

> Eg-1:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])

Slice From the Start
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

> Eg-2:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

Slice To the End
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

> Eg-3:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

Negative Indexing
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

> Eg-4:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
