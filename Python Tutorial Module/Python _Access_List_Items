- Access Items
- List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:

> Eg-1:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])  #banana


Negative Indexing :
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

> Eg-2:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])   #cherry

Range of Indexes :
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

> Eg-3:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])   ( # cherry,orange,kiwi )    #This will return the items from position 2 to 5.
                                                #Remember that the first item is position 0,
                                                #and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included

> Eg-4:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])  ( # apple,banana,cherry,orange )

                                          #This will return the items from index 0 to index 4.
                                          #Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 4 is the fifth item
                                          #Remember that the item in index 4 is NOT included


Range of Negative Indexes:
- Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:


> Eg-5:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])  ( # orange , kiwi , melon )

                                                #Negative indexing means starting from the end of the list.
                                                #This example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)
                                                #Remember that the last item has the index -1,
                                                
                                                
Check if Item Exists :
- To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword: 

> Eg-6:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")   # "Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list"
