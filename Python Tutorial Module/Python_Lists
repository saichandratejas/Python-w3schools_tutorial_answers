⚪ Python Lists :

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

⚪ List :

-Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
-Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
-Lists are created using square brackets:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)   # "apple", "banana", "cherry"


⚪ List Items :

- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

- List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.


⚪ Ordered :

- When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

- If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

⚪ Changeable :

- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.


⚪ List Items - Data Types :

- List items can be of any data type :

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]


- A list can contain different data types :

- A list with strings, integers and boolean values:


⚪ type() :

- From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]   # <class 'list'>


⚪ The list() Constructor :

- It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
- Using the list() constructor to make a List:

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)    #['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
