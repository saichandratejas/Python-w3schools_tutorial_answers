The Syntax:
**  newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]  **
The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

List Comprehension :
- List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Example:
- Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.
- Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside

> Eg-1:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)      #['apple', 'banana', 'mango']


- With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:

> Eg-2:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)    #['apple', 'banana', 'mango']

Condition:
The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

> Eg-3:

- Only accept items that are not "apple":

newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
                                    #The condition if x != "apple"  will return True for all elements other than "apple", making the new list contain all fruits except "apple".
                                    #The condition is optional and can be omitted



Iterable:
- The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

> Eg-4:

- You can use the range() function to create an iterable:

newlist = [x for x in range(10)]


Expression:
- The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list


> Eg-5:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]
print(newlist)   #['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY', 'KIWI', 'MANGO']


> Eg-6:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]
print(newlist)    #['hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello']


> Eg-7:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
print(newlist)  #['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']
