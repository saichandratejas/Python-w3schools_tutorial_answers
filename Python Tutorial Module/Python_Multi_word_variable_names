Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

> CAMEL CASE : Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
     EG : myVariableName = "John"
> PASCAL CASE : Each word starts with a capital letter:
     EG : MyVariableName = "John"
> SNAKE CASE : Each word is separated by an underscore character:
    EG : my_variable_name = "John"
